<h2 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1 Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h2><p>Mere position control is not suffice is contact is made between end-effector and environment.</p>
<p>So introduce <strong>hybrid position/force controller</strong> to solve the problem. This method is one formalism through which industrial robots might someday be controlled in order to perform tasks requiring force control.</p>

<li><p>Pick and place operations</p>

<li><p>Future: assembly-line tasks, force is extremely important.</p>
<p>Currently, the dexterity of manipulators remains <strong>quite low</strong> and limit their appplication in the automated assembly area.</p>

</ul>
<p>If we can <strong>measure and control contact forces</strong> generated at the hand, we  can <strong>imporove the performance without</strong> using bigger, heavier, and more expensive manipulator.</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Idea"><a href="#Basic-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Basic Idea"></a>Basic Idea</h2><p>Every manipulation task can be broken down into <strong>subtasks</strong> that are defined by a particular <strong>contact situation</strong> occurring between the manipulator end-effector (or tool) and the work environment. </p>
<p>With each subtask, we can associate a set of <strong>constrains</strong></p>

<li>mechanical</li>
<li>geometric</li>
