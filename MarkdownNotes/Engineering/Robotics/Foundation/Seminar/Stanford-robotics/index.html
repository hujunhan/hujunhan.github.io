<h2 id="Control-Oriented-Learning-for-Dynamical-Systems">2. Control-Oriented Learning for Dynamical Systems.</h2><p>The seminar is about “Control-Oriented Learning for Dynamical Systems.” It focuses on the interplay between learning and <strong>control</strong>, particularly in the context of robotics.</p>
<h3 id="One-or-more-of-the-research-problems-the-speaker’s-work-address">2.1. One or more of the research problems the speaker’s work address</h3><ul>
<li>Difficulty in modeling robotic systems operating under <strong>different conditions</strong>, such as icy roads, wind conditions, and contact situations.</li>
<li>The <strong>limitations of naive regression</strong> for closed-loop control tasks that happen over long time horizons.</li>
<li>The need for a learning approach that is more <strong>adaptable</strong> and efficient for closed-loop control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works">2.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hujunhan/cloudimage/master/img/20230710220204_pZmZBx.png" alt="image-20230710220204066"></p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker proposes “control-oriented learning,” which conditions the model to perform better in closed-loop control.</li>
<li>This approach involves three different lines of work:</li>
<li>Translating the concept of <strong>stabilizability into algebraic</strong> conditions used as a regularizer for closed-loop control performance during offline learning.</li>
<li>Structuring the model appropriately offline to yield a useful control <strong>close-up controller based on Linear Quadratic Regulator</strong> (LQR).</li>
<li>Using meta-learning to learn a good extension to a nominal model for adaptive control.</li>
<li>These methods work because they focus on the downstream control objective rather than just the model fitting objective. They also leverage the inherent structure of the systems to enable control design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers">2.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are you testing on like quadcopters throughout and is it dependent on how linear the Dynamics of the Drone is the results you’re showing here?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The method is pretty agnostic to the system. It was tested on a quadcopter for one project, but it can be applied to other systems as well. The difference in performance between the method and baselines increases with the nonlinearity of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are there a certain a priori structure you impose on that class of functions when regressing over models F to learn?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> In the first project, the system is assumed to be control affine (f of x plus b of x times U). There are some assumptions about the system that simplify the application of inequality conditions, such as some sparsity in that b of X.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What would happen if the Dynamics that you’re trying to learn are not actually controllable or maybe there is some subset of the states that are controllable and some that are uncontrolled?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> You would have to find some way of dividing those things out. In linear systems, you can look at ideas like common decomposition where you can break down the controllable states from the uncontrollable states.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway">2.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><ul>
<li>Control-oriented learning can significantly improve the performance of robotic systems operating under different conditions.</li>
<li>This approach is more adaptable and efficient than traditional methods, focusing on the <strong>downstream control</strong> objective rather than just the model fitting objective.</li>
<li>The speaker’s work demonstrates that this method outperforms naive and certificate-based methods in terms of sample efficiency and performance, and can even beat the oracle when enough data is available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Aligning-Human-and-Robot-Representations">3. Aligning Human and Robot Representations</h2><p>The seminar is about “Aligning Human and Robot Representations.” It focuses on the challenge of aligning the <strong>understanding and interpretation of tasks</strong> between humans and robots, particularly in the context of human-robot interaction.</p>
<h3 id="One-or-more-of-the-research-problems-the-speaker’s-work-address-1">3.1. One or more of the research problems the speaker’s work address</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty in aligning</strong> human and robot representations, leading to misinterpretation of tasks and suboptimal performance.</li>
<li>The limitations of traditional learning methods that require handcrafted representations or end-to-end deep learning methods that generalize poorly.</li>
<li>The need for a learning approach that can efficiently learn from human supervision and adapt to different human capabilities and preferences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works-1">3.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><ul>
<li>The speaker proposes a “divide and conquer” approach to robot learning, focusing first on <strong>learning the representation from human input</strong> before learning the downstream task.</li>
<li>The approach involves learning features one at a time from human supervision, using a method called “feature traces” where the human provides a <strong>sequence of states with monotonically decreasing feature values</strong>.</li>
<li>The robot can then use these feature traces to learn a <strong>feature function</strong>, and this method has been shown to generalize well to more complex settings, including perceptual features and motion features.</li>
<li>The speaker also introduces a method for the robot to autonomously detect when its representation is misaligned with the human’s, using a model that estimates the robot’s confidence in explaining the human’s input.</li>
<li>These methods work because they leverage human input in a structured and efficient way, allowing the robot to <strong>learn and adapt to human preferences</strong> and capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers-1">3.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are you learning these features one by one?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the features are learned one at a time from human supervision using a method called “feature traces.” This allows the robot to focus on learning each feature individually, which can lead to more accurate and generalizable learning.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How easy is it to combine these features? Are you assuming that they are starting from the same value?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The features are normalized to be between zero and one, which makes the reward learning easier. However, this is not mandatory and the features do not have to start from the same value. The important thing is that the features need to be positive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway-1">3.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><ul>
<li>The “<strong>divide and conquer</strong>“ approach to robot learning can significantly improve the alignment of human and robot representations, leading to better performance and adaptability in human-robot interaction.</li>
<li>This approach allows robots to learn from human supervision in a structured and efficient way, and to autonomously detect when their representation is misaligned with the human’s.</li>
<li>The speaker’s work demonstrates the potential of this method in various applications, including <strong>personal robotics, semi-autonomous driving,</strong> and shared autonomy, and highlights the importance of aligning representations in successful human-robot interaction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Connecting-Robotics-and-Foundation-Models">4. Connecting Robotics and Foundation Models</h2><p>The seminar is about the integration of machine learning and robotics, specifically focusing on the use of deep learning for robotic manipulation tasks.</p>
<h3 id="One-or-more-of-the-research-problems-the-speaker’s-work-address-2">4.1. One or more of the research problems the speaker’s work address</h3><ul>
<li>The speaker addresses the challenge of <strong>applying machine learning to real-world</strong> robotic tasks. This includes issues such as the <strong>variability</strong> of real-world environments and the difficulty of collecting <strong>sufficient training data.</strong></li>
<li>The speaker also discusses the problem of <strong>transferring</strong> learned skills from one task or environment to another, which is a major challenge in robotics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works-2">4.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><ul>
<li>The speaker proposes a novel approach that combines deep learning with reinforcement learning. This approach allows the robot to <strong>learn from its own experiences</strong>, rather than relying solely on pre-programmed instructions.</li>
<li>The speaker’s solution works because it allows the robot to <strong>adapt</strong> to new situations and tasks. It also reduces the amount of training data required, as the robot can learn from its own trial-and-error experiences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers-2">4.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li>Question:</li>
</ul>
<p>How does the robot learn from its own experiences?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The robot uses a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning. It learns to <strong>associate its actions with the resulting changes</strong> in its environment, and it adjusts its behavior based on the outcomes of its actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Question:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How does the robot handle new tasks or environments?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The robot uses a technique called <strong>transfer learning.</strong> This allows it to apply the skills it has learned in one context to new contexts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway-2">4.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><ul>
<li>The most important takeaway from the seminar is the potential of combining machine learning and robotics. This approach allows robots to learn from their own experiences and adapt to new tasks and environments, which is a major step forward in the field of robotics.</li>

<h2 id="Adaptable-Robotic-Manipulation-Using-Tactile-Sensors">7. Adaptable Robotic Manipulation Using Tactile Sensors</h2><p>The seminar is about adaptable robotic manipulation using tactile sensors. The speaker discusses the challenges of integrating robots into our daily lives, particularly in <strong>contact-rich environments</strong> such as kitchens, healthcare, and e-commerce pipelines. The speaker presents their research on developing tactile sensors for robots to handle contact events better, focusing on two specific projects: in-hand manipulation using <strong>multimodal slip sensing</strong> and <strong>haptic exploration</strong> and grip monitoring of a suction cup gripper.</p>
<h3 id="One-or-more-of-the-research-problems-the-speaker’s-work-address-4">7.1. One or more of the research problems the speaker’s work address</h3><ul>
<li>Robots struggle in contact-rich environments due to their inability to handle <strong>contact events</strong> well.</li>
<li>The <strong>unpredictable</strong> nature of contact, including <strong>unknown friction</strong> coefficients and <strong>inertia of objects</strong>, makes adaptive control challenging.</li>
<li>Tactile sensors, while developed and commercially available, are not often seen in robots due to difficulties in <strong>generalization across different robot hardware,</strong> tasks, and contact physics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works-4">7.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><ul>
<li>The speaker developed a compact multimodal sensor using a single transducer, called the “<strong>nib array sensor</strong>“, capable of monitoring linear and rotational slip in a more generalizable manner. This sensor can detect normal pressure, shear force, and vibrations, which are useful for estimating slip direction.</li>
<li>The speaker also developed a “<strong>smart suction cup</strong>“ that can directly measure local contacts without interfering with suction seal formation. This is achieved by redesigning a single bellows suction cup to have internal four chambers connected to pressure sensors. The sensors measure the leakage flow through each chamber, providing valuable information about the contact state.</li>
<li>The speaker’s solutions work because they directly address the challenges of contact-rich environments. The nib array sensor can adapt to changing contact conditions, while the smart suction cup can find the best contact location and monitor the grip during manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers-4">7.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How does the nib array sensor differentiate between linear and rotational slip?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The sensor measures the capacitance between electrodes and a grounded conductive fabric. When the nib vibrates due to slip, it causes a directional capacitance change. By observing the direction of this change, the sensor can estimate the direction of the slip.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How does the smart suction cup work?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The smart suction cup has internal four chambers, each connected to a pressure sensor. These sensors measure the leakage flow through each chamber, providing information about the contact state. This design allows the cup to measure local contacts without interfering with the suction seal formation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are the main challenges in expanding the use of tactile sensors in robots?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The main challenges include the wiring and processing of large tactile arrays. Current approaches often involve a central processor querying the tactile sensing information, which may not be efficient for large arrays. A shift towards a system more like the human nervous system, where sensors inform the central processor when they have a stimulus, may be more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway-4">7.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><p>The most important takeaway from the seminar is the potential of tactile sensors in improving the adaptability and functionality of robots in contact-rich environments. The speaker’s research on the nib array sensor and the smart suction cup demonstrates innovative approaches to overcoming the challenges of contact events in robotics. These developments could pave the way for more widespread integration of robots into our daily lives.</p>
