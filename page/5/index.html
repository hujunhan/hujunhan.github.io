          <h2 id="Goal">1. Goal</h2><p>因为头发长得比较快而且是短发类型，需要经常修剪。</p>
<p>去理发店耗费大量时间精力，充满不确定因素。</p>
<p>自己剪头发，熟能生巧，逐渐掌握适合自己的发型，且随时修改，方便快捷</p>
<h2 id="Tool">2. Tool</h2><p>自己理发需要一些工具，不是必须但是有的话能大大提升效率</p>
<ul>
<li>普通剪刀：平剪，用于剪掉100%的头发</li>
<li><strong>牙剪</strong>（重要）：有不同去量型号，比如15%，30%等等，就是每次剪下去会有15%或者30%的头发被剪掉，我在给自己的理发过程中主要使用这一工具，因为每次去量较少，所以结果不具有破坏性</li>
<li><strong>多面镜子</strong>（重要）：有专门的理发镜子，三折，通过这种方式可以看到自己侧边和后边的发型，</li>
<li>电动推子：配合不同长度的头，可以达到精准控制长度的效果</li>
<li>吸尘器：自己理发会有很多头发掉落在身上以及地上，理完发及时清洁可以避免碎发跟随脱衣或衣物扩散至其他地方</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Principle">3. Principle</h2><p>基本原则是：</p>
<ul>
<li>最重要：在不确定效果时，少量修改，如果看到效果不满意就换种方式。基于Feedback的理发方式，早起频率可以在1天一次，熟练之后可以一周一次</li>
<li>目的：达到自己想要的发型，只要自己看着顺眼即可，所以需要先观察，观察自己当前的发型有哪些不满意的地方，比如说xx地方突出来了，xxx地方太平整，没有层次</li>
<li>胆大心细：一开始的时候总会有剪错的时候，发现发型的问题之后尝试解决方案，用牙剪可以避免重大失误。效果不好就及时停止，并记住错误的方式，等头发恢复一点再尝试其他方式即可</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Method">4. Method</h2><p>具体方法：</p>
<ul>
<li><p>目标：总体来说，一个顺眼的发型应该是和脸型所呼应搭配的，整体轮廓应该是流畅和饱满的。所以头发的轮廓在修剪时需要观察自己脸部的走向，尤其是下颚和颧骨，想象齐延伸线，发型的轮廓应该大致落在延伸线上</p>
</li>
<li><p>层次：刚开始理发时最容易遇到的问题是剪出非常呆板的发型，主要原因是没有层次，头发都是同一长度，导致变成类似蘑菇头的效果。解决方法是分区理发，将头分为顶部，两边和后脑。一般来说，顶部的头发可以稍微剪短一些，顶部到两边中间过渡的头发则可以稍微长一些，两边的头发又可以剪短一些，这样可以达到简单的3个层次。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Example">5. Example</h2><p>通过两年多自己理发的经历，慢慢总结出适合自己的理发方式和要点</p>
<ol>
<li>洗头吹干，让头发在自然状态下再进行修剪</li>
<li>修剪两侧：将头顶头发捋到中间，修剪两侧。主要方式就是通过牙剪以平行于下颌延长线的方向，由外向内慢慢修剪，直至两侧头发的轮廓落在延长线附近，同时通过镜子观察两侧的效果。</li>
<li>修剪中间：将头顶头发揪起一缕，用手指夹住，用平剪剪掉末端长度（少量），用同样的方式将头顶区域的头发整体剪短一定长度</li>
<li>修剪过渡：经过上面两步，这时把头发放到原来的位置时，多半会出现有一些头发刺出来，这是两边和头顶之间的头发，修剪过渡的方式也可类似于头顶，但是修剪末端时利用牙剪而不是平剪，达到剪碎末端的效果，使得过渡区域不僵硬，有一些自然过渡的效果。有时候长时间没有大修会出现多边形的情况，这种情况下需要在多边形的那个角上慢慢用牙剪修剪，相当于将角剪掉，可以实现圆润的过渡</li>
<li>精细修剪：大体步骤完成，再次洗头吹干。将一些细枝末节的小瑕疵修剪干净</li>
</ol>

          <h2 id="Vision-For-a-Better-World">1. Vision For a Better World</h2><p>How to do that (in general)? Find how current world behave bad, (not ideal from my view). fix it</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>People do too much work or thing for a living, so they don’t have time for thins they really enjoy</li>
<li>Imbalance of wealth</li>
<li>Unfair between people, power uneven distribution</li>
<li>Environmental issue</li>
</ul>
<p>How to solve the problem?</p>
<ol>
<li>Robot and Artificial Intelligence should operate the main thing (physical and digital world). For example, the farms, power plant, and other facilities</li>
<li>Push the governments distribute enough wealth to everyone</li>
</ol>
<p>Main Issue</p>
<ul>
<li>The selfish nature of human being, make it hard to achieve real equal and fair</li>
<li>While pushing robot to replace human worker, there would be unemployment issue before the productivity achieve new stage</li>
</ul>
<p>Practical Step</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting automation</li>
<li>re-skilling and education</li>
<li>regulation and safety</li>
<li>Weath distribution</li>
<li>Fair Taxation</li>
<li>Encourage social entrepreneurship</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Transparency</li>
<li>Access to opportunities</li>
<li>Environmental Issue</li>
<li>Sustainable pracitices</li>
<li>Influence Policy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Politics-Changer">2. Politics Changer</h2><p>Goal: Push government treat people well</p>
<p>Original plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>re-build the system</li>
<li>Take a good example</li>
<li>For unfair nation, take act for forced fair</li>
<li>Apply success template, new tech</li>
</ol>
<p>New plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build Awareness: inform and educate public</li>
<li>Collect data and conduct research</li>
<li>Lobbying: network of influencers</li>
<li>Policy proposal</li>
<li>Public pressure</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Robot-wise-Helper">3. Robot-wise Helper</h2><p>Goal: Build all kinds of robots, mainly two part</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical Robot: run in the real world. Help people do physical work, like in the factory, farms etc</li>
<li>Software Robot: run in the digital world, help people make decision and keep everything in record, from automation work to AI technology</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Physical-Robot">3.1. Physical Robot</h3><p>How: work in seperate workspace &#x2F; collaborative robots, safety issue</p>
<p>What: mainly work in production area</p>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Construction</li>
<li>Farming</li>
<li>Facilities..</li>
</ul>
<p>Chanllenge</p>
<ul>
<li>Un-predictable environment</li>
<li>Movement: Need to build all kind of movement base to work on different terrian</li>
<li>Task operation: Currently most jobs are done by human, so human hand is no-doubt the best option, however, it’s too difficult to build. May need to design a set of task gripper</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Software-Robot">3.2. Software Robot</h3><p>How: work in digital world, work with human in every single day and way</p>
<p>What: mainly work in life experience area and keep system working</p>

<li>Recommendatio</li>
<li>Health</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenge</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Privacy issue</p>
</li>
<li><p>System: how to connect everything and make it aware of other software robot, API stantard</p>
</li>
<li><p>Power, it may require very intensive computation resources and electrical power, how to do that on edge device. cloud computing</p>
</li>
</ul>

          <h2 id="Conclusion">1. Conclusion</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Interdisciplinary Approach</strong>: Many of these seminars showcase the interdisciplinary nature of robotics, highlighting the combination of engineering, computer science, and even biology and physics. Examples include “Snakes &amp; Spiders, Robots &amp; Geometry” by Ross L. Hatton, “Robots and Biosystems” by Kevin Lynch, and “DNA and gammaPNA in programmable nanomaterials…” by Rebecca Taylor.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>: A significant number of these seminars deal with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the context of robotics. Talks like “Learning to Generalize beyond Training” by Deepak Pathak, “Deep Learning for Robotics” by Pieter Abbeel, and “Machine Learning and Model Predictive Control for Adaptive Robotic Systems” by Byron Boots reflect the current focus of the field.</li>
<li><strong>Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</strong>: Many seminars discuss aspects of how robots interact with humans, either physically or in terms of communication. For example, “Towards Robust Human-Robot Interaction” by Stefanos Nikolaidis, “Enabling Grounded Language Communication for Human-Robot Teaming” by Thomas Howard, and “Human-Robot Interactive Collaboration &amp; Communication” by Heni Ben Amor, highlight the significance of HRI in modern robotics.</li>
<li><strong>Space and Field Robotics</strong>: Some talks focus on the use of robotics in space or fieldwork applications. “Mars Robots and Robotics at NASA JPL” by Vandi Verma and “Robotic Grippers for Planetary Applications” by Aaron Parness exemplify space robotics, while “Autonomous and Intelligent Robots in Unstructured Field Environments” by Girish Chowdhary and “The World’s Tiniest Space Program” by Zachary Manchester underscore field robotics.</li>
<li><strong>Design and Control</strong>: Several seminars delve into the design and control of robotic systems, which can range from the microscale to the macroscale, or even complex, autonomous vehicles. Examples include “Design and control of insect-scale bees and dog-scale quadrupeds” by Avik De, “Design, Modeling and Control of a Robot Bat” by Seth Hutchinson, and “Modeling, Design, and Analysis for Intelligent Vehicles…” by Chung-Wei Lin.</li>
<li><strong>Perception and Environment Interaction</strong>: Seminars such as “Next-Generation Robot Perception…” by Luca Carlone, “Understanding the Physical World from Images” by David Fouhey, and “Perception-Action Synergy in Uncertain Environments” by Jing Xiao highlight the importance of perception and the ability of robots to understand and interact with their environments.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability and Social Impact</strong>: A few seminars also touch upon topics related to sustainability and social impact, like “Robots Should Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle” by Chelsea Finn and “What (else) can you do with a robotics degree?” by Nidhi Kalra.</li>

<h2 id="Control-Oriented-Learning-for-Dynamical-Systems">2. Control-Oriented Learning for Dynamical Systems.</h2><p>The seminar is about “Control-Oriented Learning for Dynamical Systems.” It focuses on the interplay between learning and <strong>control</strong>, particularly in the context of robotics.</p>
<h3 id="One-or-more-of-the-research-problems-the-speaker’s-work-address">2.1. One or more of the research problems the speaker’s work address</h3><ul>
<li>Difficulty in modeling robotic systems operating under <strong>different conditions</strong>, such as icy roads, wind conditions, and contact situations.</li>
<li>The <strong>limitations of naive regression</strong> for closed-loop control tasks that happen over long time horizons.</li>
<li>The need for a learning approach that is more <strong>adaptable</strong> and efficient for closed-loop control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works">2.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hujunhan/cloudimage/master/img/20230710220204_pZmZBx.png" alt="image-20230710220204066"></p>
<ul>
<li>The speaker proposes “control-oriented learning,” which conditions the model to perform better in closed-loop control.</li>
<li>This approach involves three different lines of work:</li>
<li>Translating the concept of <strong>stabilizability into algebraic</strong> conditions used as a regularizer for closed-loop control performance during offline learning.</li>
<li>Structuring the model appropriately offline to yield a useful control <strong>close-up controller based on Linear Quadratic Regulator</strong> (LQR).</li>
<li>Using meta-learning to learn a good extension to a nominal model for adaptive control.</li>
<li>These methods work because they focus on the downstream control objective rather than just the model fitting objective. They also leverage the inherent structure of the systems to enable control design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers">2.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are you testing on like quadcopters throughout and is it dependent on how linear the Dynamics of the Drone is the results you’re showing here?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The method is pretty agnostic to the system. It was tested on a quadcopter for one project, but it can be applied to other systems as well. The difference in performance between the method and baselines increases with the nonlinearity of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are there a certain a priori structure you impose on that class of functions when regressing over models F to learn?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> In the first project, the system is assumed to be control affine (f of x plus b of x times U). There are some assumptions about the system that simplify the application of inequality conditions, such as some sparsity in that b of X.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What would happen if the Dynamics that you’re trying to learn are not actually controllable or maybe there is some subset of the states that are controllable and some that are uncontrolled?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> You would have to find some way of dividing those things out. In linear systems, you can look at ideas like common decomposition where you can break down the controllable states from the uncontrollable states.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway">2.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><ul>
<li>Control-oriented learning can significantly improve the performance of robotic systems operating under different conditions.</li>
<li>This approach is more adaptable and efficient than traditional methods, focusing on the <strong>downstream control</strong> objective rather than just the model fitting objective.</li>
<li>The speaker’s work demonstrates that this method outperforms naive and certificate-based methods in terms of sample efficiency and performance, and can even beat the oracle when enough data is available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Aligning-Human-and-Robot-Representations">3. Aligning Human and Robot Representations</h2><p>The seminar is about “Aligning Human and Robot Representations.” It focuses on the challenge of aligning the <strong>understanding and interpretation of tasks</strong> between humans and robots, particularly in the context of human-robot interaction.</p>
<h3 id="One-or-more-of-the-research-problems-the-speaker’s-work-address-1">3.1. One or more of the research problems the speaker’s work address</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Difficulty in aligning</strong> human and robot representations, leading to misinterpretation of tasks and suboptimal performance.</li>
<li>The limitations of traditional learning methods that require handcrafted representations or end-to-end deep learning methods that generalize poorly.</li>
<li>The need for a learning approach that can efficiently learn from human supervision and adapt to different human capabilities and preferences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works-1">3.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><ul>
<li>The speaker proposes a “divide and conquer” approach to robot learning, focusing first on <strong>learning the representation from human input</strong> before learning the downstream task.</li>
<li>The approach involves learning features one at a time from human supervision, using a method called “feature traces” where the human provides a <strong>sequence of states with monotonically decreasing feature values</strong>.</li>
<li>The robot can then use these feature traces to learn a <strong>feature function</strong>, and this method has been shown to generalize well to more complex settings, including perceptual features and motion features.</li>
<li>The speaker also introduces a method for the robot to autonomously detect when its representation is misaligned with the human’s, using a model that estimates the robot’s confidence in explaining the human’s input.</li>
<li>These methods work because they leverage human input in a structured and efficient way, allowing the robot to <strong>learn and adapt to human preferences</strong> and capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers-1">3.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Are you learning these features one by one?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the features are learned one at a time from human supervision using a method called “feature traces.” This allows the robot to focus on learning each feature individually, which can lead to more accurate and generalizable learning.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How easy is it to combine these features? Are you assuming that they are starting from the same value?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The features are normalized to be between zero and one, which makes the reward learning easier. However, this is not mandatory and the features do not have to start from the same value. The important thing is that the features need to be positive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway-1">3.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><ul>
<li>The “<strong>divide and conquer</strong>“ approach to robot learning can significantly improve the alignment of human and robot representations, leading to better performance and adaptability in human-robot interaction.</li>
<li>This approach allows robots to learn from human supervision in a structured and efficient way, and to autonomously detect when their representation is misaligned with the human’s.</li>
<li>The speaker’s work demonstrates the potential of this method in various applications, including <strong>personal robotics, semi-autonomous driving,</strong> and shared autonomy, and highlights the importance of aligning representations in successful human-robot interaction.</li>

<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works-2">4.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><ul>
<li>The speaker proposes a novel approach that combines deep learning with reinforcement learning. This approach allows the robot to <strong>learn from its own experiences</strong>, rather than relying solely on pre-programmed instructions.</li>
<li>The speaker’s solution works because it allows the robot to <strong>adapt</strong> to new situations and tasks. It also reduces the amount of training data required, as the robot can learn from its own trial-and-error experiences.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers-2">4.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li>Question:</li>
</ul>
<p>How does the robot learn from its own experiences?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The robot uses a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning. It learns to <strong>associate its actions with the resulting changes</strong> in its environment, and it adjusts its behavior based on the outcomes of its actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Question:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How does the robot handle new tasks or environments?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The robot uses a technique called <strong>transfer learning.</strong> This allows it to apply the skills it has learned in one context to new contexts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway-2">4.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><ul>
<li>The most important takeaway from the seminar is the potential of combining machine learning and robotics. This approach allows robots to learn from their own experiences and adapt to new tasks and environments, which is a major step forward in the field of robotics.</li>

<h2 id="Adaptable-Robotic-Manipulation-Using-Tactile-Sensors">7. Adaptable Robotic Manipulation Using Tactile Sensors</h2><p>The seminar is about adaptable robotic manipulation using tactile sensors. The speaker discusses the challenges of integrating robots into our daily lives, particularly in <strong>contact-rich environments</strong> such as kitchens, healthcare, and e-commerce pipelines. The speaker presents their research on developing tactile sensors for robots to handle contact events better, focusing on two specific projects: in-hand manipulation using <strong>multimodal slip sensing</strong> and <strong>haptic exploration</strong> and grip monitoring of a suction cup gripper.</p>
<h3 id="One-or-more-of-the-research-problems-the-speaker’s-work-address-4">7.1. One or more of the research problems the speaker’s work address</h3><ul>
<li>Robots struggle in contact-rich environments due to their inability to handle <strong>contact events</strong> well.</li>
<li>The <strong>unpredictable</strong> nature of contact, including <strong>unknown friction</strong> coefficients and <strong>inertia of objects</strong>, makes adaptive control challenging.</li>
<li>Tactile sensors, while developed and commercially available, are not often seen in robots due to difficulties in <strong>generalization across different robot hardware,</strong> tasks, and contact physics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-the-novel-approach-or-idea-behind-the-speaker’s-solution-Why-it-works-4">7.2. What is the novel approach or idea behind the speaker’s solution, Why it works</h3><ul>
<li>The speaker developed a compact multimodal sensor using a single transducer, called the “<strong>nib array sensor</strong>“, capable of monitoring linear and rotational slip in a more generalizable manner. This sensor can detect normal pressure, shear force, and vibrations, which are useful for estimating slip direction.</li>
<li>The speaker also developed a “<strong>smart suction cup</strong>“ that can directly measure local contacts without interfering with suction seal formation. This is achieved by redesigning a single bellows suction cup to have internal four chambers connected to pressure sensors. The sensors measure the leakage flow through each chamber, providing valuable information about the contact state.</li>
<li>The speaker’s solutions work because they directly address the challenges of contact-rich environments. The nib array sensor can adapt to changing contact conditions, while the smart suction cup can find the best contact location and monitor the grip during manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Questions-that-maybe-asked-by-an-unexperienced-robotics-engineer-and-Answers-4">7.3. Questions that maybe asked by an unexperienced robotics engineer and Answers</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How does the nib array sensor differentiate between linear and rotational slip?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The sensor measures the capacitance between electrodes and a grounded conductive fabric. When the nib vibrates due to slip, it causes a directional capacitance change. By observing the direction of this change, the sensor can estimate the direction of the slip.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> How does the smart suction cup work?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The smart suction cup has internal four chambers, each connected to a pressure sensor. These sensors measure the leakage flow through each chamber, providing information about the contact state. This design allows the cup to measure local contacts without interfering with the suction seal formation.</li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> What are the main challenges in expanding the use of tactile sensors in robots?</li>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The main challenges include the wiring and processing of large tactile arrays. Current approaches often involve a central processor querying the tactile sensing information, which may not be efficient for large arrays. A shift towards a system more like the human nervous system, where sensors inform the central processor when they have a stimulus, may be more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Takeaway-the-most-important-takeaway-4">7.4. Takeaway, the most important takeaway</h3><p>The most important takeaway from the seminar is the potential of tactile sensors in improving the adaptability and functionality of robots in contact-rich environments. The speaker’s research on the nib array sensor and the smart suction cup demonstrates innovative approaches to overcoming the challenges of contact events in robotics. These developments could pave the way for more widespread integration of robots into our daily lives.</p>

<p>I hope this email finds you well.</p>
<p>In accordance with California Civil Code §1950.5, I am formally requesting the return of my security deposit that I believe has been improperly withheld following my vacating the premises at 833 W El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, CA on June 12, 2023.</p>
<p>Please find attached a letter detailing my concerns regarding an excessive $2400 charge for repainting the apartment, and the lack of an appropriately itemized statement describing the work performed, the time spent, and the reasonable hourly rate charged.</p>
<p>The letter outlines the steps I am prepared to take if we are unable to resolve this dispute, including pursuing a small claims action.</p>
<p>I am open to discussion in order to reach a fair resolution to this matter. I kindly ask you to review the attached letter and provide me with your feedback at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Best regards,1</p>
